- **React** Framework Library Web Application Optimism Burn Station Web Application currently deployed on the OP ETH Goerli Testnet enables users to burn their OP Tokens, decreasing circulating supply, subsequently increasing the value of the OP Tokenomics.

- **NextJs** is a frontend JavaScript framework built on React's UI library that is lightweight, server-rendered, and flexible. Developers typically use Next. js to build static, fully interactive sites and apps that are fast and easy to use.

- **Metamask** is also integrated, enabling users to connect their Metamask wallet to burn OP Tokens, as a transaction with the server side
Ethereum Deployed Solidty Smart Contract

- **Sanity** Datastore is the schemaless backend that stores and query's JSON documents including all users and their transaction history, and subscribe to real-time changes. It comes with a query API that uses the query language GROQ to quickly filter down to the documents exactly the data structured using those schemas. 

- **Hardhat** is the development environment that compiled and deployed this **dApp** on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Solidity** was the object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network to design the OP Burner smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain platform.

- **Optimism** is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers. Built as a minimal extension to existing Ethereum software, Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture scales your Ethereum apps without surprises. This project was deployed to the Goreli Optimism Testnet, and is scable to the Optimism Mainnet.

- **Tailwind.css** makes it quicker to write and maintain the application code. By using this utility-first framework, don't have to write custom CSS to style in the  application. Instead, use utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of the application.

- **tsParticles** is library used for the interatcive live particles background display, allowing for improved UX embedded within the User Interface.
